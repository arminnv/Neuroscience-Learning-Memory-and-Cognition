    "In this section, we aim to analyze the dynamics of Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) over time. This can be achieved using a sliding window technique. Set the window size to `0.25sec` and slide it with `75%` overlap across the ERP signals for each channel in both odorants. Within each window, calculate the PAC and then average it over the phase frequency range of theta band `4Hz-8Hz`. Finally, generate time-frequency plots for PAC between each pair of channels (local PAC and inter-regional PAC). You can use the `calc_PAC()` function you've written in the previous section. Compare the results and find the effect of odorants in the neural connectivities. *`20 Points`*"
